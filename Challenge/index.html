        Have you ever stopped to think that your body is a host for millions of tiny microrganisms? How about that everyone has a unique set of microrganisms on their body at all times? The human microbiome is a crucial part of human functionality, but which species of bacteria are currently living in your belly button? Our team sampled hundreds of people to see what kinds of bacteria currently reside in the pit on your stomach as well as how often someone will scrub that area and how that will affect their microbiome. The purpose of this study was to not only see what types of tiny organisms are found on the human body, but also contribute to the growing science of the microbiome. When microbes create enviroments on another organism this is called a microbiome. These microbiomes will extremely vary from organism to organism and play key roles in the health of that organism. In humans we are just begining to unravel the mysteries of the gut microbiome, but what remains a true mystery is the skin microbiome. The skin microbiome plays a significant role in the health of the skin in a human. Our skin is the first line of defense against invading pathogens so naturally, a diverse and well-maintained skin microbiome will lower our chance of getting sick while boosting your immune system! Interestingly there is no "Perfect" microbiome, on this page you can select different participants and see unique types of bacteria all equally beneficial!
